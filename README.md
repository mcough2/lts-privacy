# Le Tour de Shore — Privacy Policy
**Effective date:** August 29, 2025

Le Tour de Shore (“the App”) helps riders view the route, see their location on a map, and ask “Ask Larry” questions about the event.

We do not sell personal data. We do not show ads. We collect only what’s needed to make the App work.

## Data We Collect

### Location (Precise)
- **What**: Your device’s precise location.
- **Why**: To show your position/blue dot on the map and related map features.
- **Where processed**: On-device and by the **Google Maps iOS SDK** to render maps/blue dot.
- **Retention**: We do not store your location on our servers.

### “Ask Larry” Questions (User Content)
- **What**: The text you type into Ask Larry.
- **Why**: To answer your question about the event (route, camping, lodging, etc.).
- **Where processed**: Sent to our proxy server (hosted on Vercel) and then to **OpenAI** to generate an answer.
- **Retention**: Minimal request logs (IP, timestamp) may be kept on the proxy for abuse prevention and reliability for up to **30 days**. We do not build profiles or link questions to your identity.

### Diagnostics (Optional)
- **What**: Crash reports and basic performance data if you opt to share with Apple and developers.
- **Why**: To fix crashes and improve stability.
- **Where processed**: Apple’s systems; summaries may be visible to the developer.
